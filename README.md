# *Statistics And R*

## *Overview Of  Project*

Jeremy is the primary analyst for the AutoRus data analytics team. The analytics team is in charge of performing retrospective analysis of historical data and analysis, verification and validation of current automation specifications and study design of future product testing.

The AutoRus's executive team recognizes that most successful automotive latches utilize data analytics in ever decision making process. Therefore Jeremy must ensure that his analysis contains a statistical backbone, a quantitative metric and clear interpretation of the results in order to keep upper management happy. 

Jeremy will need to perform statistical tests using R programming language. He will need to provide summary statistics for different variables, the visualizations for different data sets and interpretation of the statistical test results. Additionally, Jeremy will propose his own study design, hypothesis and analysis work flow in order to make AutoRus manufacturing process even better.
